## Prerequisites
Before starting make sure you have the following:
- **Visual Studio:** Download the latest version from [Official Microsoft Website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- **.Net Framework:** Download .Net Desktop Development from Visual Studio or you can download from here [Microsoft official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks)
- **SQL Server Management System:** Download the latest version of SSMS from [Official Microsoft Website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16)

## Get Started

1. **Clone to this repository:** Obtain your own copy of the project:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sszobaer/PharmacyManagementSystem.git
    cd sszobaerahmed.dev
    ```
2. **Database Configuration:** 

   **Database Setup Instructions**

1. **Create a New Server in SSMS:**
   - **Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).**
   - **Connect to a Server:**
     - In the "Connect to Server" window, enter your server details. If you're setting up a new server, use the default settings or consult your IT team for specifics.
     - Click "Connect" to establish a connection to the server.
   - **Create a New Database (if needed):**
     - Right-click on "Databases" in the Object Explorer pane.
     - Select "New Database..."
     - Enter the database name (e.g., `PharmacyManagementSystem`), and click "OK."

2. **Access Database Files:**
   - Go to your repository and navigate to the "database" section.
   - Locate and download the SQL script files for each table.

3. **Execute SQL Scripts:**
   - Open a new query window in SSMS by clicking "New Query."
   - Copy and paste the SQL scripts from the downloaded files into the query window.

4. **Script Execution Order:**
   - Execute the SQL scripts in the following order to ensure proper table relationships:
     - `SignUpTable`
     - `AdminTable`
     - `DepartmentTable`
     - `EmployeeTable`
     - `SalaryTable`
   - **Note:** For the initial script (e.g., `SignUpTable`), use `CREATE DATABASE PharmacyManagementSystem;` instead of `USE PharmacyManagementSystem;` to create the database if it doesnâ€™t already exist.

5. **Run the Scripts:**
   - Execute each script in the specified order to set up your database.

Adjust the sequence or add additional tables as necessary for your setup.
3. **Library Dependencies:** Add the MSSQL developer tool:
   - Get the [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
