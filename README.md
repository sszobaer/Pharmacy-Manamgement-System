## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Visual Studio:** [Download the latest version](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- **.NET Framework:** Available via Visual Studio or [Microsoft's official site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks)
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** [Download the latest version](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16)

## Get Started

### Clone the Repository

Obtain your own copy of the project with:
    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sszobaer/PharmacyAppliactionManagementSystem.git
cd PharmacyApplicationManagementSystem
```

### Database Configuration

**Database Setup Instructions:**

1. **Create a New Server in SSMS:**
   - Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
   - Connect to your server using the appropriate credentials.
   - To create a new database, right-click on "Databases" in the Object Explorer pane, select "New Database...", enter `PharmacyManagementSystem`, and click "OK."

2. **Access Database Files:**
   - Navigate to the "database" section in this repository.
   - Download the SQL script files for each table.

3. **Execute SQL Scripts:**
   - Open a new query window in SSMS.
   - Copy and paste or directly open the SQL scripts from the downloaded files into the query window.

4. **Script Execution Order:**
   - Run the SQL scripts in this order:
     1. `SignUpTable`
     2. `AdminTable`
     3. `DepartmentTable`
     4. `EmployeeTable`
     5. `SalaryTable`
   - **Note:** When setting up the database for the first time, use `CREATE DATABASE PharmacyManagementSystem;` if the database doesn't exist, rather than `USE PharmacyManagementSystem;`.

5. **Configure Connection String:**
   - In the **app.config** or **web.config** file of your WinForms application, update the connection string with your SQL Server details:

   ```xml
   <connectionStrings>
     <add name="PharmacyDB"
          connectionString="Data Source=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Initial Catalog=PharmacyManagementSystem;Integrated Security=True"
          providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
   </connectionStrings>
   ```

   - Replace `YOUR_SERVER_NAME` with the name of your SQL Server instance (for example, `localhost` or `.\SQLEXPRESS`).

6. **Integrated Security:**
   - If you're using **Windows Authentication** to access your database, the `Integrated Security=True` setting should work fine.
   - If you're using **SQL Server Authentication**, replace `Integrated Security=True` with the `User ID` and `Password` for your SQL Server credentials:

   ```xml
   <connectionStrings>
     <add name="PharmacyDB"
          connectionString="Data Source=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Initial Catalog=PharmacyManagementSystem;User ID=yourUsername;Password=yourPassword"
          providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
   </connectionStrings>
   ```

Make sure the connection string is set up properly to ensure smooth communication between your application and the database.

### Library Dependencies

- Ensure you have the [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) developer tools installed.
